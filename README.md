About Daily Tracker

I was in charge of developing the frontend as well as the backend of the application, integrating advanced functionalities (SharedPreferences, Providers) and optimizing the user experience. 

- use Flutter/Dart with the help of functions like (providers,listener,SharedPreferences), using design patterns and MVC( model view controller). It was chosen thanks to its power to create platforms with a strong and easy-to-use graphics engine.

- Firebase by google (Authentication Email, Firestore Database, Firebase Storage,)

- Tools like Canva and figma to create the entire user interface and the different logos of the app

- also Trello, Jira to be able to organize the various tasks and agile methodologies such as scrum by carrying out "sprints" and "daily scrum"
